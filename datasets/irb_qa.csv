The application is then reviewed by the IRB committee for compliance with ethical guidelines and regulatory requirements."
"How long does IRB review typically take?","IRB review typically takes 4-6 weeks for expedited review and 8-12 weeks for full board review, depending on the complexity of the study and the completeness of the submission materials."
"What are the key elements of informed consent?","Informed consent must include: study purpose, procedures, risks/benefits, confidentiality, voluntary participation, right to withdraw, and contact information. It must be written in language understandable to participants."
"What are the requirements for exempt research?","Exempt research must meet specific criteria outlined in the Common Rule, including minimal risk, no vulnerable populations, and specific research categories. Examples include educational research and anonymous surveys."
