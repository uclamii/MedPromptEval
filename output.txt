QUESTION: What are the genetic changes related to leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation ?

======================================== CORRECT ANSWER ========================================
LBSL is caused by mutations in the DARS2 gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. This enzyme is important in the production (synthesis) of proteins in cellular structures called mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells. While most protein synthesis occurs in the fluid surrounding the nucleus (cytoplasm), some proteins are synthesized in the mitochondria.  During protein synthesis, in either the mitochondria or the cytoplasm, building blocks (amino acids) are connected together in a specific order, creating a chain of amino acids that forms the protein. Mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase plays a role in adding the amino acid aspartic acid at the proper place in mitochondrial proteins.  Mutations in the DARS2 gene result in decreased mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase enzyme activity, which hinders the addition of aspartic acid to mitochondrial proteins. It is unclear how the gene mutations lead to the signs and symptoms of LBSL. Researchers do not understand why reduced activity of mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase specifically affects certain parts of the brain and spinal cord.

======================================== SYSTEM PROMPT TEMPLATE ========================================
You are an expert prompt engineer. Your task is to create a single system prompt for a chatbot that answers medical questions using the role based methodology: Assume the role of a specialist most relevant to the medical domain. Provide expert analysis and interpretation specific to this type of medical data. Ensure that the system prompt is clear and instructs the chatbot effectively. Only provide the system prompt as a text output, do not provide any other text besides the prompt. Do not generate any code.

What are the genetic changes related to leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation ?

======================================== FULL ANSWER ========================================
Leukoencephalopathy is a condition that affects the white matter of the brain, which contains nerve fibers responsible for transmitting information between different parts of the body. Brainstem refers to the lower part of the brain that controls vital functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. Spinal cord involves the central nervous system's pathway from the brain down through the spine. Lactate elevation occurs when there is an increase in lactic acid levels in the bloodstream or tissues due to inadequate oxygen supply. 

In terms of genetics, mutations in certain genes have been linked to this disorder. These include the PEX1 gene on chromosome 2q32-33, the SLC25A5 gene on chromosome 1p36, and the MCT8 gene located at 5q31.2-3. Mutations in these genes affect the production or function of proteins involved in energy metabolism, leading to abnormal accumulation of substances like lactic acid in the cells. This results in damage to the myelin sheath surrounding neurons (nerve cells) in the brain and spinal cord, causing the characteristic features of leukoencephalopathy. The exact mechanism by which this leads to specific neurological deficits varies depending on the affected areas of the brain and spinal cord. Some common signs and symptoms may include weakness, difficulty walking, seizures, vision problems, cognitive impairment, speech difficulties, and swallowing issues. Treatment options focus on managing symptoms, preventing complications, and providing supportive care. Genetic counseling and testing may be recommended if other family members show similar symptoms or carry the same mutation. Regular monitoring of health status and early intervention can improve outcomes for individuals with this rare disease.
